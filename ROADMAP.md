# Claude Code Tray — Roadmap (active backlog)

> **Single source of truth for task status.** Flat, one line per task.
> Only **unshipped** work lives here (📋 designed · 💭 idea · ⏳ partial · 🛠 in-progress).
> Shipped work is moved to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); design rationale (the *what/why* per task)
> lives in [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md); positioning/distribution decisions live in
> [STRATEGY.md](STRATEGY.md).
>
> **This file is written by `roadkeep`, not by hand.** The id, the `(deps: … ✅)` annotation and the
> `→ §` pointer are derived on render, and the field limits in
> [roadkeep.toml](roadkeep.toml) are refused at insertion rather than reported afterwards. The
> `roadkeep` skill says which command to call; a hand-edit is denied by the hook.
>
> **An entry is one sentence: what + why + `→` pointer**, ≤320 characters, symptom in bold and never
> named after its fix. The `→` points at the section in IMPROVEMENTS.md with the full design.
>
> **How to pick work:** `roadkeep pick` — the lowest-numbered task whose `deps` are all shipped, with
> the reason it was chosen. `roadkeep brief <id>` is everything it costs to start one, in one call.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 📋 | Designed but not started |
| 💭 | Idea worth exploring; needs design |
| ⏳ | Partial — direction is right, more work remains |
| 🛠 | In progress |

## Block AG — The interaction check grew two cases, and nobody runs it

> Block AD doubled what `Check-Interaction.ps1` asserts, and every item here came out of building or
> running those cases rather than out of planning them: one is a latent id collision the new case only
> avoids by the order it reads in, two are ways a check can quietly stop asserting, and two are the cost
> of a loop that a person has to remember.
> Design: [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md) §XX.
>
> Ordered by what can make a green run meaningless, then by what keeps the loop being run at all.

## Block AE — Extra usage is money, and the tray is asleep for it

> A field report against an account working past 100%: the overage reading is fetched, reaches one
> conditional line of tooltip, and changes nothing else on screen.
> Design: [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md) §XVIII — the report, the four signals already parsed, and
> the two constraints that bind every task here.
>
> Ordered by what is losing data today, then by what every string here is waiting on, then by what a
> user would actually see.

## Block AB — What Block Z's own work left behind

> Four things surfaced *while building* Block Z that are part of none of its tasks and were reported by
> nobody: two the block itself grew, two about the checks meant to protect it.
> Design: [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md) §XV.
>
> Ordered by what is wrong on screen today, then by what protects the rest.

## Block AC — The tray reports the switch it performed, not the switch the machine got

> A field report against shipped Block T: the tray and `/usage` named different profiles, and both were
> right about different questions. Three distinct ways the choice fails to reach a new session, and the
> tray distinguishes none of them.
> Design: [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md) §XVI — the measurement, and the A/B/C split the tasks follow.
>
> Ordered by what is wrong for every user today, then by what makes the result checkable.

## Block AI — Verification — the checks that prove a change

## Block AJ — Working here — the repo's own docs and flags

## Block G — Localization

- 💭 **T216** (deps: —) **One machine, two number conventions: the page decides, not the app** — T167 picked invariant for one window, while the Context page, the tray toast and the System page format the same figures with L.Culture, and the sweep it added reaches neither. → §XXI.1

## Block D — Auth & API resilience

- 📋 **T224** (deps: —) **The tray infers permission to overspend from a local file, and cannot see the API refusing it** — Resolve reads hasExtraUsageEnabled out of a file Claude Code writes, while a second account answers rejected with org_level_disabled - the reading Allows was deferred until. → §XXIII.1

## Block N — System information — your plan, your install, this machine

- 📋 **T225** (deps: —) **One directory is counted twice when two entries differ only in the case of the drive letter** — The project count is the number of keys under projects, and Windows paths are case-insensitive, so d:/Git/x and D:/Git/x are one folder reported as two. → §XXIV.1

## Block E — Reset notifications & toasts

- 📋 **T227** (deps: —) **Every toast draws its emoji as a flat black glyph** — The Emoji TextBlock inherits the window's Segoe UI font stack, which has no colour glyphs, so the party popper the README prints in colour is a monochrome outline on the card itself. → §XXV.1
- 📋 **T228** (deps: —) **A card can cut its own text off, and the capture is written anyway** — The card is a fixed height chosen against the English wording, so a longer translation pushed the caption past the bottom edge and --capture-toast wrote the clipped PNG out with 'wrote' and exit 0. → §XXV.2

## Block S — Settings round-trip

- 📋 **T229** (deps: —) **A toggle flipped in the tray menu is undone by pressing Save in a window that was already open** — Two fields the menu writes have a control on the Claude Code page and no [TrayOwned] marker, so the page hands back the snapshot it was built with and the newer value loses. → §XXVI.1

## Block Q — Keyboard input in the windows

- 📋 **T234** (deps: —) **The sentence saying how far a profile pick reaches is announced to nobody** — A ToolStripMenuItem's ToolTipText reaches no UIA property, so T171's scope line and T172's tip are invisible to a screen reader and to every check. → §XXVIII.1

## Non-goals (do NOT add as tasks)

Binding constraints — see [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md) §I for the full text. Summary:

- **No tokenizer dependency, and no NuGet package in general** The single self-contained `.exe` plus
  installer story depends on it, so token counts stay estimates with a visible "≈" — §I.3.
- **Never read message content** Usage counts, model ids, flags, tool and skill *names* and the
  session `cwd` only, and no content display or export anywhere in the app — §I.1.
- **No network** Beyond the usage API and GitHub Releases: no telemetry, no analytics, no crash
  reporting, and every computation local — §I.2.
- **Not a memory editor, not a Claude Code config manager.** Hooks, MCP servers, permissions and
  instruction files are measured, never edited, and T77 settled it with no write path at all — §I.4.
- **Never swap a credential or config file to switch accounts.** Block O switches by launching with
  a different `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, because the file-juggling alternative races Claude Code's own
  refresher — §I.6.
- **No switching the account of a running session.** The environment is fixed when the process
  starts, so a profile change applies to the next session and the UI says so rather than implying
  otherwise.
- **Profiles are contexts, not quota pools.** No string anywhere may suggest changing accounts
  because one hit its limit, which is limit circumvention wearing a convenience costume — §I.7.
- **Don't swap the UI stack.** WinForms owns the tray icon and WPF owns the windows on one STA
  thread, with no imperative `Dock=Top` stacking and no hardcoded hex — §I.5.
- **No second source of truth for the version** `<Version>` in `ClaudeTray.csproj` is the one place
  a version lives, and everything else derives from it — §I.5.
- **No usage annotation on memory files** Settled by dropping T85: a recall is the harness injecting
  a file, and no memory analogue of `attributionSkill` exists to read — §I.8.
- **No activity-aware tray notification** Settled by T87: the shaped projection changed what the
  chart says, not what is worth interrupting somebody for.
- **No live hint on the tray icon** Settled by dropping T101: it needs a transcript tail running all
  session, undoing the one property that keeps T99 free when nobody is looking.
- **No pricing or positioning discussion as a numbered task.** It goes in
  [STRATEGY.md](STRATEGY.md), which is where a decision that is not work belongs.
