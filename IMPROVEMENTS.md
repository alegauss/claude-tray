# Claude Code Tray — Design rationale (IMPROVEMENTS)

> The **what/why** behind *unshipped* work. Status lives **only** in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) — never put ✅/📋 markers in this file's prose.
>
> **When a task ships, delete its design subsection here.** `git log` is the history. Letting
> shipped implementation reports accrete in this file is the single failure mode it exists to avoid.
>
> Sections are Roman-numbered and referenced from the roadmap as `→ §III` — `ref_scheme = "outline"`
> in [roadkeep.toml](roadkeep.toml), because a number is never reused and an old commit's `→ §V` has
> to keep pointing where it pointed. A section is budgeted in words there too, and `roadkeep lint`
> exits 1 on a pointer that resolves to nothing.

## §I — House constraints

Binding for every task. These are product decisions, not preferences — a task that violates one is
wrong even if it works.

### §I.1 Privacy promise

The app reads only what Claude Code already stores locally, and from transcripts **only** usage
counts, model ids, flags, tool/skill *names* and the session `cwd` — **never message content**. This
is the app's whole trust model. Any new reader of `~/.claude` inherits it.

### §I.2 No network beyond two endpoints

The usage API (`ApiClient`) and GitHub Releases (`Updater`). Nothing else — no telemetry, no
analytics, no crash reporting. Every scan and every computation is local.

### §I.3 Zero extra dependencies

The single self-contained `.exe` + installer story depends on the app having no third-party
packages. WPF's built-in Fluent theme, GDI+ and `System.Text.Json` are the toolkit. A task that
wants a NuGet package needs to justify breaking this first (see §I.5).

### §I.4 Read-only against `~/.claude`

The app observes; it does not manage Claude Code. It never edits `CLAUDE.md`, memories, skills,
hooks, MCP servers or permissions.

**Settled with T77: there is no exception.** The archive-with-undo that was under design (move files
to `memory/.archive/<date>/`) was deliberately *not* built. What shipped instead is a generated
cleanup prompt: the app writes down what it measured — paths, sizes, token estimates — and hands that
to Claude Code, which can read the files and decide. Measuring is a read; rewriting somebody's memory
directory on a size heuristic is a different risk class, and the tool that can actually read the file
should be the one to touch it. Revisit only with a concrete reason the copy-a-prompt path cannot
cover.

### §I.5 What NOT to build (binding non-goals)

- **No tokenizer dependency.** Token counts stay estimates with a visible "≈". A real
  tokenizer would mean a native/managed dependency and break §I.3.
- **Not a memory editor / not a config manager.** Measure and advise; hand the edit to Claude.
- **No content display or export**, anywhere, ever — sizes, names, frontmatter, timestamps, counts.
- **Don't swap the UI stack.** WinForms owns the tray icon (WPF has no native tray support); WPF owns
  windows. Both live on one STA thread pumped by `Application.Run(new TrayContext())`. This is
  settled — see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
- **Don't stack imperative layout.** Layout is declarative XAML with explicit rows/columns; the
  original WinForms sidebar overlapped precisely because it relied on reverse `Dock=Top` add-order.
- **No hardcoded hex for theme-able surfaces** — `{DynamicResource}` Fluent brushes only, so light,
  dark and the system accent all follow for free.
- **No second source of truth for the version.** `<Version>` in `ClaudeTray.csproj`; everything else
  derives from it.

### §I.6 Never swap a credential or config file

Block O switches profiles by launching Claude Code with a different `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, never by
moving files around. The alternative was measured and refused: the access token lasts 8 hours and
the refresh token 5 days, `.credentials.json` is rewritten on every refresh and `.claude.json` is
rewritten constantly, so a copy-and-restore scheme races Claude Code's own refresher. It also splits
one identity across two files, and the failure mode is the tray being the thing that broke
somebody's login. §I.4 has no exception, and credential material is the last place to invent one.

### §I.7 Profiles are contexts, not quota pools

No string anywhere in the app may suggest changing accounts because one hit its limit. Monitoring
two subscriptions, each with its own token, is reading what you own; nudging somebody to hop when a
window maxes out is limit circumvention wearing a convenience costume, and it would contradict the
README's own terms section. The constraint is violated by implication as readily as by wording —
§XVI.4 refused a quota bar animating one account's remaining quota into another's, on the grounds
that it says the forbidden sentence without a string.

### §I.8 No usage annotation on memory files

T75 annotates skills and agents because an invocation is a real tool call; a recall is the harness
injecting a file into the conversation, and the app never reads message content (§I.1). T85 was
parked pending a structured signal, and the signal was then looked for rather than waited on. Across
530 local transcripts (195,451 lines) the harness records four kinds of provenance —
`attributionSkill`, `attributionAgent`, `attributionMcpServer`, `attributionMcpTool` — and sixteen
attachment kinds including `skill_listing` and `agent_listing_delta`, and none of them concerns a
memory. No `memor*`/`recall*` field exists at all. The only memory paths recorded are in
`file-history-snapshot`, which tracks files Claude *wrote* — the opposite signal, and one that would
flag the memories being maintained as the ones in use. So memory rows stay blank, and a wrong "never
used" — the one error an advisor must not make — stays impossible by construction. Reopen only if a
memory analogue of `attributionSkill` appears; the re-check is written down on `UsageEvidence`.

## §III — Measured baseline (context load)

Taken from one real developer machine (33 project dirs, 19 with memory). Project names are withheld
deliberately — this file is published with the repo. The right-hand column is the rule (now shipped in
`ContextRules.cs`) the observation justifies.

| Observation | Value | Rule it proves |
|---|---|---|
| Heaviest memory dir | 122 files / 316 KB | size rules |
| `MEMORY.md` index (eager, every session) | 20 KB ≈ 5.4k tokens | index size |
| Index pointers vs memory files | 121 pointers / 122 files, none dead (the extra index *lines* are headers); one unindexed memory in another project | stale pointers / orphan memories |
| Largest single memory file | 18 KB | "one fact" |
| Memory dirs byte-identical to a sibling | 2 pairs | duplication |
| Project dirs whose path no longer exists | 2 (+1 that is not a path at all) | orphans |
| `type:` distribution | 93 project / 12 feedback / 2 reference / 0 user | frontmatter |
| Plugin skills available | 31 `SKILL.md`, largest 33 KB, ≈3.1k tokens of eager descriptions | the eager/lazy split — bodies are lazy, the 31 descriptions are not |
| `settings.json` | 87 KB | settings bloat |
| Base overhead (system prompt + tools + MCP) | ≈32k tokens, p25 30k / p75 34k | shown as its own gauge segment, never folded into a project's number |
| Heaviest scannable eager load | ≈22k tokens (a 43 KB `AGENTS.md` + 20 KB index) | the hero number the gauge shows |

## §XV — What Block Z's own work left behind (Block AB)

Block Z was five tasks about what the app *says* and what protects what it says. Building it surfaced four
things that belong to none of them, and the reason to write them down as a block rather than as stray
fixes is that all four are the same failure of attention: **the thing you are looking at is not the thing
you are checking.** Two were on screen in the very screenshots taken to verify the block (a number in the
wrong locale, a paragraph that has quietly become twelve lines); two are in the checks written to protect
it (a decision that lives where no assertion can reach it, a skip that may never have run outside one
machine). None was reported by anybody, and none of them would be.

## §XVI — The tray reports the switch it performed, not the switch the machine got (Block AC)

The report is a question, not a bug: *"mudei para o Pessoal, mas se eu digito `/usage`, aparece
Trabalho"*, with the inference that `/usage` must be lying. It was not. The session was on the work account
and the tray was showing the personal one: **both correct about different questions**, and nothing in the
app connects them.

The first theory was wrong instructively. The suspicion was a race, the write being asynchronous since
T149; measured (§XVI.3), it is not. The variable had never been written *at all* until the Windows-wide
switch was ticked, three minutes after the editor that asked the question had started. **A spinner
verifies the click; what needs verifying is the result.**

Three failure modes hide behind the one symptom, and separating them comes first:

- **A — the write is never attempted.** `SyncEnvironmentProfile` is off (the default), so
  `SyncEnvironmentToPin` returns immediately. This is the one that happened. → §XVI.1
- **B — the write is attempted and its outcome is never read.** `Adopt` returns *accepted*, by design.
  → §XVI.3
- **C — the write lands and the next process still misses it.** A child inherits its parent's environment
  block at creation; the editor's parent was an Explorer from six hours earlier, and Explorer's refresh on
  `WM_SETTINGCHANGE` is a courtesy, not a guarantee. → §XVI.2

C bounds the block: **no registry check proves the next process will see the value.** Hence §XVI.2
displays the effective value continuously rather than asserting it once at the pick.

## §XVIII — Extra usage is money, and the tray is asleep for it (Block AE)

The report indicts the whole feature: *"apesar de estar em 100% de uso, ainda funcionava, porque estava
com uso extra ativado — mas no Claude Tray isto não aparece evidente, nem no gráfico, nem no tray, em
lugar nenhum"*. The user worked straight through a number the app called a ceiling.

This is a block and not a missing feature because **none of the data is missing**:

| Signal | Where it is read | What is done with it |
|---|---|---|
| `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-overage-utilization` | `ApiClient.FetchAsync` → `UsageData.Extra` | one tooltip line, only when `> 0.001` |
| `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-overage-reset` | → `UsageData.ResetExtra` | the countdown on that same line |
| `hasExtraUsageEnabled` (`.claude.json` → `oauthAccount`) | `ClaudeAccount` → `ClaudeInfo.ExtraUsage` | one text row on the System page |
| `anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-status` | `UsageData.Status` | printed verbatim in the tooltip; read by nothing |

Three of the four predate the Statistics window. The gap is not acquisition: **nothing downstream
believes the account can be past 100% and still working** — §XVIII.1 has the measurement.

Two constraints bind. The **privacy promise** is not in tension: rate-limit headers are quota metadata,
§I.1 restricts *transcripts*, and this block adds no transcript reading and no endpoint. The
**"profiles are contexts, not quota pools"** non-goal is in tension throughout — every task makes
overage more visible, and the next sentence, *this account is out, the other has room*, is the one the
roadmap forbids. §XVIII.6 binds hardest; §XVI.4 found the answer's shape: a receipt, not a reward.

## XX Verification — the checks that prove a change (Block AI)

This project's checks are three loops with different reaches. `--selftest` asserts arithmetic on
synthetic inputs and runs on every push. `Check-Interaction.ps1` is the only thing in the repository
that reads the *running* UI, and since T194 one of its five cases runs on every push too. The
previews and captures are pictures, and a picture cannot see a key press arrive.

Everything filed here was found by *using* those loops rather than by reviewing them, which is the
pattern worth keeping: the defects a check has are not visible in its source, only in what it
reports on a machine that is not the author's.

One shape recurs and is worth naming once. A check does not usually break loudly — it stops
asserting and stays green. T192 was an id lookup with two candidates that picked by tree order; T193
was a fallback route that turned an assertion into a note; T196 was a rule governing thirty-odd
controls asserted on three. None of them ever went red. That is why the exit codes now distinguish a
degraded run from a clean one, and why an assertion that could have run and did not is named and
counted rather than mentioned.

## XXI Numbers in prose — one convention, or a stated split (Block G)

Two surfaces of this app answer the same question differently, and T167's sweep reaches only one of
them. What files here is the rule that picks a convention, and the check that holds every surface to
it.

## XXII Working here — what earns a byte of AGENTS.md (Block AJ)

AGENTS.md is loaded every turn and is at its budget, so the file is zero-sum: what goes in now
displaces something, and nothing records which rules have earned the bytes they cost.

## XXIII What the API says about permission, and what the app infers instead (Block D)

Every signal this app has about whether an account may spend past its included quota is inferred
from a file or from an effect. The API states it directly, on every response, and nothing here has
ever been able to read the statement — because until a second account was probed there was only one
sample and it could not be told apart from a default.

## XXIV This machine's install, read from a file another program writes (Block N)

The System information page reports the machine rather than the app, so every figure on it is read
out of files Claude Code owns and this app only opens. What those files are allowed to contain is
therefore not this app's decision, and a count taken over them is a claim about their shape.

## XXV Toast cards — what the card actually draws (Block E)

Two things the toasts got wrong that no capture ever objected to, both found by looking at a card
rather than at the code that built it.

## XXVI One setting, two places that change it (Block S)

The tray menu and the Settings page now both write fields the page believes it owns, and only one of
the two knows the other exists.

## XXVIII Input, focus, and being readable (Block Q)

What a control ANNOUNCES, as against what it draws. A picture cannot see an accessible name and
neither can any check, so this is the block where a surface that renders perfectly and tells
assistive technology nothing gets filed.

## XXIX The Context Load Inspector's own read-out (Block I)

The headless side of the inspector: what a script driving it can tell about a run, as opposed to
what a person reading the output can.

## XXX Dates — the words are translated and the order is not (Block G)

What a date reads like once the month name is French and the arrangement is still English.

## XXXI The release path, from the machine it is run on (Block B)

What cutting a release costs on a developer machine, as opposed to on a runner that has nothing else
installed.

### XXXI.1 The build that cannot say what is in its way

Measured, and from the second of two independent causes. T258 fixed a check script that leaked trays
and locked the next build; this one is nobody leaking anything - the resident tray IS
`bin\Release\...\publish\ClaudeTray.exe`, which is where a developer who installed by building runs
it from. `dotnet publish` then fails at `GenerateBundle` with a raw
`System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path ... is denied` and four frames of MSBuild.

That is the release path. `build-installer.cmd` step 1 is the publish, with no check in front of it,
so the one command that matters at release time fails with a stack trace about a bundler instead of
the sentence a person can act on: quit the tray, or run it from somewhere else.

T258 named this question and deferred it - whether a build whose output is locked should say so as
itself rather than as ten retries of a copy - on the grounds that the leak was the fixable half. The
leak is fixed and the question outlived it, which is the argument for answering it now: the
remaining cause is not a bug to remove but a normal state a person is in.

The shape is small, and there is precedent for a refusal that names what is in the way (T199 names
the window it copied, T205 names the page it will not capture): before the publish, if a process is
running from the path about to be written, say which pid and which path, and stop. What has to be
decided with it is whether the script offers to stop that process. It should not - the tray is the
user own running app, and a build script that kills applications is worse than one that asks.
